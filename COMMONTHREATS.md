SQL injection is blocked by using Supabase’s parameterized queries and input validation. I am blocking SQL injection by using Supabase’s client libraries, which use parameterized queries by default. This prevents direct injection of user input into SQL statements.

XSS is reduced by escaping user content and never rendering raw HTML. In React (and Next.js), any user input is displayed as plain text and not executed as code. I avoid using dangerouslySetInnerHTML or setting innerHTML directly, which are the main ways XSS can occur in React apps. 

Implementing authentication and authorization: Ensure only authenticated and authorized users can access or modify data.

Validating and sanitizing all user input: Prevent malicious data from reaching the database.

Limiting database permissions: Use least-privilege principles for database users and roles.

Using HTTPS: Encrypt data in transit to prevent interception or tampering.
Enabling rate limiting and throttling: Prevent brute-force and denial-of-service attacks.

Monitoring and logging database activity: Detect suspicious or unauthorized access patterns.

Regularly updating dependencies: Patch vulnerabilities in database drivers and libraries.
