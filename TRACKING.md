# Tracking and Privacy

## What I Track
- Page views and time spent on page to improve user experience.

## How I Respect Your Privacy
- All data is anonymized (e.g., no IP addresses are stored(well masked by 2 bytes)).
- No cookies are used for tracking, but they are used for purposes of deleting/modifying user data, at the request of the user.
- Users can opt out of tracking at any time.
- Data is only stored for 180 days 

## Why I Track
- To understand how users interact with the application.
- To identify and fix bugs.
- To improve performance and usability.
