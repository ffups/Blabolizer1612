# Tracking and Privacy

## What I Track
- Page views and time spent on page to improve user experience.

## How I Respect Your Privacy
- All data is anonymized (e.g., no IP addresses are stored).
- No cookies are used for tracking.
- Users can opt out of tracking at any time.

## Why I Track
- To understand how users interact with the application.
- To identify and fix bugs.
- To improve performance and usability.


1. Decide What to Track
Focus on collecting only the data you need. Examples include:

Usage Metrics: Page views, button clicks, or API request counts.
Error Tracking: Logs for debugging and improving the application.
Performance Metrics: Page load times or API response times.
Avoid collecting sensitive personal data unless absolutely necessary.


2. Use a Privacy-Friendly Analytics Tool
Instead of traditional analytics tools like Google Analytics, consider privacy-focused alternatives:

Matomo: Open-source and self-hosted analytics.
Plausible: Lightweight and privacy-friendly analytics.
Simple Analytics: No cookies or personal data collection.
These tools are designed to comply with privacy regulations like GDPR.

3. Implement Tracking
Hereâ€™s an example of how to track page views and button clicks using a custom logging system:

4. Respect User Privacy
Anonymize Data: Remove or mask personal identifiers (e.g., IP addresses).
Use Cookies Sparingly: Avoid unnecessary cookies. Use localStorage or sessionStorage for non-sensitive data.
Provide Opt-Out Options: Allow users to opt out of tracking.
Example: Add an Opt-Out Option


5. Explain Tracking in a Privacy Policy
Create a TRACKING.md file in your repository to explain:

What data is collected.
Why it is collected.
How user privacy is respected.
Example TRACKING.md:

6. Comply with Privacy Regulations
Ensure compliance with privacy laws like GDPR, CCPA, or others:

Consent: Ask for user consent before enabling tracking.
Data Retention: Store data only as long as necessary.
Transparency: Clearly explain your tracking practices.
